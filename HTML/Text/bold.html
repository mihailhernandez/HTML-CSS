<!-- By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make
     characters appear bold. The <b> element also represents
     a section of text that would be presented in a visually different
     way (for example key words in a paragraph) although the use of
     the <b> element does not imply any additional meaning. -->
<p>This is how we make a word appear <b>bold</b>.</p>
<p>Inside a product description you might see some
    <b>key features</b> in bold.</p>

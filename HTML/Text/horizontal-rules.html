<!-- To create a break between themes — such as a change of
     topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a
     horizontal rule between sections using the <hr /> tag.
     There are a few elements that do not have any words between
     an opening and closing tag. They are known as empty elements
     and they are written differently. An empty element usually
     has only one tag. Before the closing angled bracket of an
     empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash
     character. Some web page authors miss this out but it is a
     good habit to get into. -->

<p>Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Jupiter is bigger that all the other planets combined.</p>

<!-- When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book,
     film or research paper, the <cite> element can be used
     to indicate where the citation is from.
     In HTML5, <cite> should not really be used for a person's
     name â€” but it was allowed in HTML 4, so most people are
     likely to continue to use it. Browsers will render the content
     of a <cite> element in italics. -->
 
<p><cite>A Brief History of Time</cite> by Stephen Hawking has sold over ten
million copies worldwide.</p>

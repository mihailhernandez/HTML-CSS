<!-- The <s> element indicates something that is no longer
     accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).
     Visually the content of an <s> element will usually be displayed
     with a line through the center. Older versions of HTML had a
     <u> element for content that was underlined, but this is being
     phased out. -->

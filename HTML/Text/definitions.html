<!-- The first time you explain some new terminology (perhaps an
     academic concept or some jargon) in a document, it is
     known as the defining instance of it.
     The <dfn> element is used to indicate the defining instance of
     a new term. Some browsers show the content of the <dfn> element in
     italics. Safari and Chrome do not change its appearance. -->

<p>A <dfn>black hole</dfn> is a region of space from which nothing, not even light,
can escape.</p>

<!-- To add an image into the page you need to use an <img>
     element. This is an empty element (which means there is
     no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

     src
     This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This
     will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your
     own site.

     alt
     This provides a text description of the image which describes the
     image if you cannot see it.

     title
     You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element
     to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers
     will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the
     user hovers over the image. -->

<img src="images/pup.jpg" 
     alt="A golden retriever puppy."
     title="My favourite dog breed is golden retriever."/>

<!-- Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced
     a new <figure> element to contain images and their caption
     so that the two are associated.

     You can have more than one image inside the <figure>
     element as long as they all share the same caption.

     <figcaption>
     The <figcaption> element has been added to HTML5 in order
     to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.
     Before these elements were created there was no way to
     associate an <img> element with its caption.

     Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements
     simply ignore the new elements and display the content of them.

<figure>
    <img src="images/otters.jpg"/>

    <figcaption>Sea otters hold hands when they sleep so they don't
                drift away from each other.</figcaption>
</figure>

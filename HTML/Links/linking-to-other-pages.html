<!-- When you are linking to other pages within the same site,
     you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You
     can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.
     If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value
     of the href attribute is just the  name of the file.
     If you have different pages of a site in different folders, then you
     can use a slightly more complex syntax to indicate where the
     page is in relation to the current page. -->

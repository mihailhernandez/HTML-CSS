<!--
     <input>
     type="submit"
     The submit button is used to send a form to the server.

     name
     It can use a name attribute but it does not need to have one.

     value
     The value attribute is used to control the text that appears
     on a button. It is a good idea to specify the words you want to
     appear on a button because the default value of buttons on some
     browsers is ‘Submit query’ and this might not be appropriate for
     all kinds of form.

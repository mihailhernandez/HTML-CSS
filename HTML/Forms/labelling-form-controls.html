     <label>
     When introducing form controls, the code was kept simple by
     indicating the purpose of each one in text next to it. However,
     each form control should have its own <label> element as this
     makes the form accessible to vision-impaired users.
     The <label> element can be used in two ways. It can:

     1. Wrap around both the text description and the form input

     2. Be kept separate from the form control and use the for
     attribute to indicate which form control it is a label for.
    
     for
     The for attribute states which form control the label belongs to.
     Note how the radio buttons use the id attribute. The value of the
     id attribute uniquely identifies an element from all other elements
     on a page.
     The value of the for attribute matches that of the id attribute
     on the form control it is labelling. This technique using the for and
     id attributes can be used on any form control. When a <label>
     element is used with a checkbox or radio button, users can click
     on either the form control or the label to select. The expanded
     clickable area makes the form easier to use. The position of the
     label is very important. If users do not know where to enter
     information or what information to enter, they are less likely to
     use the form correctly.

     As a rule of thumb, here are the best places to place labels on
     form controls.

<!-- 
     <select>
     size
     You can turn a drop down select box into a box that shows more
     than one option by adding the size attribute. Its value should
     be the number of options you want to show at once. In the
     example you can see that three of the four options are shown.
     Unfortunately, the way that browsers have implemented this
     attribute is not perfect, and it should be tested throroughly if
     used (in particular in Firefox and Safari on a Mac).

     multiple 
     You can allow users to select multiple options from this list by
     adding the multiple attribute with a value of multiple.

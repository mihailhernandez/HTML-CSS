     <form>
     Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element
     should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a
     method and id attribute too.

     action
     Every <form> element requires an action attribute. Its value
     is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the
     information in the form when it is submitted.

     method
     Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
     With the get method, the values from the form are added to
     the end of the URL specified in the action attribute. The get
     method is ideal for:

     ● short forms (such as search boxes)
     ● when you are just retrieving data from the web server
       (not sending information that should be added to or deleted
        from a database)

     With the post method the values are sent in what are
     known as HTTP headers. As a rule of thumb you should use the
     post method if your form:

     ● allows users to upload a file
     ● is very long
     ● contains sensitive data (e.g. passwords)
     ● adds information to, or deletes information from, a database

     If the method attribute is not used, the form data will be sent
     using the get method.

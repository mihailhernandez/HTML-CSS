     The most popular way of adding Flash into a web page
     is using JavaScript. There are several scripts that allow you
     to do this without an in-depth understanding of the JavaScript
     language.

     One advantage to using this technique is that it allows
     browsers to show alternative content for users whose
     browsers are not capable of showing Flash.

     This technique uses a <div> element to create a space where
     the Flash movie should sit. The <div> element has an id
     attribute whose value is used by the SWFObject script. In this
     example, the value of the id attribute is bird.
     Inside the <div> element you can place the alternative content
     for users who are not able to play Flash.

     The SWFObject script will check to see if the user's browser can
     play the Flash movie. If it can, the script will replace the content of
     the <div> with the .swf file.

     For users who cannot see the Flash movie, you could show a
     still from the movie instead. You might also like to consider using
     a text description of the Flash file.

     If you use a text description as alternative content, then you can
     achieve two further benefits:

     1. The text can be accessed by those with visual and/or physical
     impairments who are not able to interact with the Flash file.

     2. The text can be indexed by search engines (which are not as
     effective at indexing SWF files), increasing the chance that your
     content will be found.

<!-- The <table> element is used to create a table. The contents
     of the table are written out row by row.
     
     You indicate the start of each row using the opening <tr> tag.
     (The tr stands for table row.) It is followed by one or more
     <td> elements (one for each cell in that row).
     At the end of the row you use a closing </tr> tag.

     Each cell of a table is represented using a <td>
     element. (The td stands for table data.)
     At the end of each cell you use a closing </td> tag.

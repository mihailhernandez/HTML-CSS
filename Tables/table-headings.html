<!-- The <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its
     purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or
     a row. (The th stands for table heading.)

     Even if a cell has no content, you should still use a <td> or
     <th> element to represent the presence of an empty cell
     otherwise the table will not render correctly. (The first cell
     in the first row of this example shows an empty cell.)
    
     Using <th> elements for headings helps people who
     use screen readers, improves the ability for search engines
     to index your pages, and also enables you to control the
     appearance of tables better when you start to use CSS.

     You can use the scope attribute on the <th> element to indicate
     whether it is a heading for a column or a row. It can take the
     values: row to indicate a heading for a row or col to indicate a
     heading for a column.

     Browsers usually display the content of a <th> element in
     bold and in the middle of the cell.

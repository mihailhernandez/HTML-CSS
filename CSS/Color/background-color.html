<!--
	CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the
	background-color property sets the color of the background
	for that box.

	You can specify your choice of background color in the same
	three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values,
	hex codes, and color names.

	If you do not specify a background color, then the
	background is transparent.

	By default, most browser windows have a white
	background, but browser users can set a background color for
	their windows, so if you want to be sure that the background
	is white you can use the background-color property on
	the <body> element.

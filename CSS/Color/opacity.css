/* 
 	 CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to
 	 specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.
 	 The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
 	 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).
 
 	 The CSS3 rgba property allows you to specify a color, just like
 	 you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to 
 	 indicate opacity. This value is known as an alpha value and is
 	 a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity
 	 and 0.15 is 15% opacity). The rgba value will only affect the 
 	 element on which it is applied (not child elements).
 	 Because some browsers will not recognize RGBA colors, you
 	 can offer a fallback so that they display a solid color. If there are
 	 two rules that apply to the same element, the latter of the two
 	 will take priority. To create the fallback, you can specify a color
 	 as a hex code, color name or RGB value, followed by the rule
 	 that specifies an RGBA value. If the browser understands RGBA
 	 colors it will use that rule. If it doesn't, it will use the RGB value.

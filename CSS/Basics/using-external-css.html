<!--
     The <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the
     browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. It is an
     empty element (meaning it does not need a closing tag), and it
     lives inside the <head> element.

     It should use three attributes:

     href
     This specifies the path to the CSS file (which is often placed in
     a folder called css or styles).

     type
     This attribute specifies the type of document being linked to. The
     value should be text/css.

     rel
     This specifies the relationship between the HTML page and
     the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when
     linking to a CSS file.

     An HTML page can use more than one CSS style sheet. To
     do this it could have a <link> element for every CSS file it
     uses. For example, some authors use one CSS file to control the
     presentation (such as fonts and colors) and a second to control
     the layout.

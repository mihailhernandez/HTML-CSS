     If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be
     visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these
     characters:

     <!-- comment goes here -->

     It is a good idea to add comments to your code because,
     no matter how familiar you are with the page at the time
     of writing it, when you come back to it later (or if someone
     else needs to look at the code), comments will make it much
     easier to understand.

     Although comments are not visible to users in the main
     browser window, they can be viewed by anyone who looks at
     the source code behind the page.

     On a long page you will often see comments used to indicate
     where sections of the page start or end, and to pass on notes to
     help anyone who is looking at the code understand it.

     Comments can also be used around blocks of code to stop
     that code from being displayed in the browser. In the example on
     the left, the email link has been commented out.

<!-- 
     Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to
     uniquely identify that element from other elements on the
     page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a
     number or any other character).

     It is important that no two elements on the same page
     have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is
     no longer unique).

     For example, you might want to assign one
     paragraph within the page (perhaps a paragraph containing
     a pull quote) a different style than all of the other paragraphs.

     If you go on to learn about JavaScript (a language that
     allows you to add interactivity to your pages), id attributes can be
     used to allow the script to work with that particular element.
     
     The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can
     be used on any element.

<p>Water and air. So very commonplace are these
   substances, they hardly attract attention - and
   yet they vouchsafe our very existence.</p>
<p id="pullquote">Every time I view the sea I feel
   a calming sense of security, as if visiting my
   ancestral home; I embark on a voyage of seeing.
</p>
<p>Mystery of mysteries, water and air are right
   there before us in the sea.</p>

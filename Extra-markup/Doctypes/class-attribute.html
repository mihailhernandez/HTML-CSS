<!--
     Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute.
     Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within
     a document, you will want a way to identify several elements
     as being different from the other elements on the page.

     For example, you might have some paragraphs of text that
     contain information that is more important than others and want
     to distinguish these elements, or you might want to differentiate
     between links that point to other pages on your own site and links
     that point to external sites.

     To do this you can use the class attribute. Its value
     should describe the class it belongs to. In the example on
     the left, key paragraphs have a class attribute whose value is
     important.

     The class attribute on any element can share the same
     value. So, in this example, the value of important could be
     used on headings and links, too.

     An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your
     page â€” and in that window you can see another page. The term
     iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.

     One common use of iframes (that you may have seen on
     various websites) is to embed a Google Map into a page. The
     content of the iframe can be any html page (either located on the
     same server or anywhere else on the web).

     An iframe is created using the <iframe> element. There are a
     few attributes that you will need to know to use it:

     src
     The src attribute specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame.

     height 
     The height attribute specifies the height of the iframe in pixels.

     width The width attribute specifies the width of the iframe in pixels.

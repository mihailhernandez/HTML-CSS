<!-- You will also often see an <img> element use two other attributes
     that specify its size:

     height
     This specifies the height of the image in pixels.

     width
     This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

     Images often take longer to load than the HTML code that
     makes up the rest of the page. It is, therefore, a good idea to
     specify the size of the image so that the browser can render
     the rest of the text on the page while leaving the right amount of
     space for the image that is still loading. -->

<img src="images/pup.jpg"
     alt="Puppy."
     title="Goldie."
     height="140"
     width="140"/>

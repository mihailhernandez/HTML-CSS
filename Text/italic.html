<!-- By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make
     characters appear italic. The <i> element also represents
     a section of text that would be said in a different way from
     surrounding content â€” such as technical terms, names of ships,
     foreign words, thoughts, or other terms that would usually be
     italicized. -->

<!--
     <input>
     If you want to allow users to upload a file (for example an
     image, video, mp3, or a PDF), you will need to use a file input
     box.

     type="file"
     This type of input creates a box that looks like a text input
     followed by a browse button. When the user clicks on the
     browse button, a window opens up that allows them to select a
     file from their computer to be uploaded to the website.

     When you are allowing users to upload files, the method
     attribute on the <form> element must have a value of post. (You
     cannot send files using the HTTP get method.)
-->

<form action="upload.php" method="post">
    <p>Upload a file here:</p>
    <input type="file" name="user-file"/></br>
    <input type="submit" value="Upload"/>
</form>

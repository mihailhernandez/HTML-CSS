<!-- 
     <input>
     type="password"
     When the type attribute has a value of password it creates
     a text box that acts just like a single-line text input, except
     the characters are blocked out. They are hidden in this way so
     that if someone is looking over the user's shoulder, they cannot
     see sensitive data such as passwords.

     name
     The name attribute indicates the name of the password input,
     which is sent to the server with the password the user enters.

     size, maxlength
     It can also carry the size and maxlength attributes like the
     the single-line text input.

<form action="login.php">
    <p>Enter password:</p>
    <input type="password" name="password" 
           size="15" maxlength="30"/>
</form>

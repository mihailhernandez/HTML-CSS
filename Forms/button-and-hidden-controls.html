<!--
     <button>
     The <button> element was introduced to allow users more
     control over how their buttons appear, and to allow other
     elements to appear inside the button.

     This means that you can combine text and images
     between the opening <button> tag and closing </button> tag.

     <input>
     type="hidden"

<form action="add.php">
    <button><img src="images/mandelbrot.jpg"
        width="20" height="20"/>Add</button>
    <input type="hidden" name="bookmark" value="lyrics"/>
</form>

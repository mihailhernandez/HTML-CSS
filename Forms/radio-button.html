     <input>
     type="radio"
     Radio buttons allow users to pick just one of a number of options.

     name
     The name attribute is sent to the server with the value of the
     option the user selects. When a question provides users with
     options for answers in the form of radio buttons, the value of
     the name attribute should be the same for all of the radio buttons
     used to answer that question.

     value
     The value attribute indicates the value that is sent to the
     server for the selected option. The value of each of the buttons
     in a group should be different (so that the server knows which
     option the user has selected).

     checked
     The checked attribute can be used to indicate which value (if
     any) should be selected when the page loads. The value of this
     attribute is checked. Only one radio button in a group should
     use this attribute.

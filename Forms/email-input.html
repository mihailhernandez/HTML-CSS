     <input>
     HTML5 has also introduced inputs that allow visitors to
     enter email addresses and URLs. Browsers that do not support
     these input types will just treat them as text boxes.

     type="email"
     If you ask a user for an email address, you can use the email
     input. Browsers that support HTML5 validation will check
     that the user has provided information in the correct format
     of an email address. Some smart phones also optimize their
     keyboard to display the keys you are most likely to need when
     entering an email address (such as the @ symbol).

<!--
     <textarea>
     The <textarea> element is used to create a mutli-line
     text input. Unlike other input elements this is not an empty
     element. It should therefore have an opening and a closing tag.
     Any text that appears between the opening <textarea> and
     closing </textarea> tags will appear in the text box when the
     page loads.

     If the user does not delete any text between these tags, this
     message will get sent to the server along with whatever the
     user has typed. (Some sites use JavaScript to clear this
     information when the user clicks in the text area.)
